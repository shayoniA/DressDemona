## Why I Built DressDemona

Finding clothes that genuinely match personal style across multiple platforms is time-consuming and fragmented. Most fashion apps rely only on filters or static recommendations. I built DressDemona to explore how AI, computer vision, and user behavior can work together to:

- Understand fashion visually, and learn evolving personal style
- Combine personal styles with web-scraped recommendations from multiple sites using LLMs
- Provide feed containing outfit recommendations of other users who share similar fashion tastes
- Create a more intuitive and human-like fashion discovery experience

## Future Improvements
